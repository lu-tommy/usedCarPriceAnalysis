# usedCarPriceAnalysis

My objective for this project is to analyze the prices of used cars and develop a predictive model that estimates their prices based on various features. To achieve this, I will undertake several key steps as described below:

First, I will import the necessary Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. This will ensure that I have access to the tools needed to perform the analysis.

Next, I will load the dataset "used_cars_data.csv," which contains information on used cars and their prices, into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

After loading the dataset, I will explore it by displaying its head (first few rows), checking its shape (number of rows and columns), and obtaining summary statistics. I will also check for any missing values and handle them appropriately.

To better understand the data and identify trends or patterns, I will create several plots to visualize the distribution of car prices, as well as the relationships between different features and the target variable (price).

Based on my data exploration and visualization, I will select the most relevant features to be used in building the predictive model. These features include 'year', 'mileage', 'manufacturer', and 'model'.

Before building the model, I will preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables such as 'manufacturer' and 'model', and scaling numerical variables such as 'year' and 'mileage'.

I will then train and evaluate various regression models, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, using scikit-learn. I will compare the models' performances by examining their mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

After identifying the best-performing model, in this case, the random forest regressor, I will further optimize it using hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Finally, I will validate the optimized model on a test dataset to ensure that its performance is consistent and reliable.

In summary, this project will involve an in-depth analysis of used car prices using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. It will include data exploration, visualization, feature selection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and validation to build a reliable predictive model for used car prices.
